* Product based:These are the company which have their own product to sell
* Service based:These copany they may not have or have their product but their primary business is providing service
*project is developeed by service based company
*product is developed by product based company
*project is a short term application development
*product is a long term application development
*client is either a person or an organization using as a service
*client is the one which will use the service and access the information
-----------------------------
*There is a server called DNS derver when we type google,com it will go to the dns server there it will check if ip is available for google
*ipconfig is a command to check ip
----------------------------------
*Client server architecture refers to a system that hosts delivers and manages most of the resources and services that is available for client-server request
*request is sent to the server by protocal.Protocal is set of rules accepted by both client and servers
*HTTP is hyper text transfer protocol
*HTTPS is a secure protocol Hyper Text Tranfer Protocol secure
-----------------------------------
Characteristics of client-server architect
1. Client and server machines they typically have different hardware.Ex chrome browser or other browser, server from IBM and Dell.Vendor company sell their hardware
2. The network has horizintal scalability which increases number of client machines and vertical scalability which increases and enhance our server capabilities
3. Horizontal scalabilty is for client side(How much client I can increase)(|)
4. Vertical scalability is used for server side to ditribute load(How much client requests can be processed)(_)
5. Both client and server side interact with transfer layer protocol
6. Server side is centralized system which will keep all the service in one palace.it improves scalability.
Disdavantegs:
1. Virus or Trojans:If we are downloading any file which is having virus then it will affect client
2. Highly vulenerable if we are using http
------------------------------------------
Types of client-server architechture
1. 1-tier(it means one layer architecture)It contains all set of settings in a single machine.setting consist of data layers
2. 2.tier(it means two layer architecture)It is preffered as best architecture presentation layer client layer will be on a different system and business lyer, database server will be on different system
below required for 2-tier architecture
*.Fat Client Thin Server:
*.Thin Client Fat Server:
3. 3-tier(it means three layer architecture):Here we create a middle ware between the client and server which is business layer.client layer(fron-ent UI layer), server layer(Dao-Data access object layer) and business layer(service , serviceimpl layer)
4. N-tier architecture
------------------------------------------
Requirements for client-server architecture
1. Web server
2. Client server and server side validation
3. File server to store small data in the file
4. registery or dns:here we will be registering our ip with name
